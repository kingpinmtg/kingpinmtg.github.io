            <h2>Basic Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Kingpin is a singleton format designed to be played by 3-5 players. Decks consist of
                75 cards. A legendary creature or planeswalker leads the deck of cards in its color
                identity from all throughout Magic's history. Starting life totals are 30.

                <h2>Banned & Restricted Announcement</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello all, it has come time for Kingpin's first ever B&R Announcement! This is
                    a very exciting milestone for us. After careful thought and consideration with
                    the release of Ikoria, here are the following changes to the Ban and Watch lists:
                </p>

                <h3>Bans</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Griselbrand</li>
                    <li>Mox Emerald</li>
                    <li>Mox Sapphire</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Watch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fierce Guardianship</li>
                    <li>Gyruda, Doom of Depths</li>
                    <li>Jegantha, the Wellspring</li>
                    <li>Kaheera, the Orphanguard</li>
                    <li>Keruga, the Macrosage</li>
                    <li>Lurrus of the Dream-Den</li>
                    <li>Lutri, the Spellchaser</li>
                    <li>Obosh, the Preypiercer</li>
                    <li>Umori, the Collector</li>
                    <li>Yorion, Sky Nomad</li>
                    <li>Zirda, the Dawnwaker</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, all of the companion cards have ended up on the watchlist, even with
                    the rules change implemented by Wizards of the Coast. We feel as though the
                    cards have not yet been properly vetted, and could pose a potential threat to the
                    overall health of the format. 
                    <br><br>
                    The bans we have selected are a result of rigorous playtesting. We discovered that
                    even with the lower life total, Griselbrand in particular, is still far too oppressive 
                    of a card, and results in card draw exceeding 14 cards fairly regularly. Furthermore,
                    Griselbrand was capable of being regularly played by turn 3, and before any players 
                    were able to respond. The decision to ban Mox Emerald and Mox Sapphire is because we 
                    believe that Green has access to many forms of ramp already, and does not need any more 
                    help from Moxen, and blue stands to gain far too much from a zero-cost, mana-generating, 
                    dedicated artifact.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we want to address the recent ban decision made by Wizards of the Coast in
                    regards to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/depictions-racism-magic-2020-06-10">Depictions of Racism in Magic</a>. 
                    While we very much understand and respect Wizards of the Coast's decision on this matter, 
                    we have ultimately decided not to follow the same path in regard to the bans. This
                    is due to ensuring that the format follows our philosophy that only cards that
                    we deem as harmful to the health of the meta game are banned.

            <p>
                Kingpin was conceived as a fast-paced singleton format with a minimal banlist, 
                while at the same time having a different spin on color identity. Our goal was 
                to maximize deck diversity while still keeping it a fun multiplayer format.
