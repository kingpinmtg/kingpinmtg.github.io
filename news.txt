Banned & Restricted Announcement

Hello all, it has come time for Kingpin's first ever B&R Announcement! This is a very exciting milestone for us. After careful thought and consideration with the release of Ikoria, here are the following changes to the Ban and Watch lists:

#Bans
*Griselbrand
*Mox Emerald
*Mox Sapphire

#Watch
*Fierce Guardianship
*Gyruda, Doom of Depths
*Jegantha, the Wellspring
*Kaheera, the Orphanguard
*Keruga, the Macrosage
*Lurrus of the Dream-Den
*Lutri, the Spellchaser
*Obosh, the Preypiercer
*Umori, the Collector
*Yorion, Sky Nomad
*Zirda, the Dawnwaker

#Rules Update
*Currently, any companion card can be the companion of a deck that meets its companion requirements.

Ultimately, all of the companion cards have ended up on the watchlist, even with the rules change implemented by Wizards of the Coast. We feel as though the cards have not yet been properly vetted, and could pose a potential threat to the overall health of the format. 
<br><br>
The bans we have selected are a result of rigorous playtesting. We discovered that even with the lower life total, Griselbrand in particular, is still far too oppressive of a card, and results in card draw exceeding 14 cards fairly regularly. Furthermore, Griselbrand was capable of being regularly played by turn 3, and before any players were able to respond. The decision to ban Mox Emerald and Mox Sapphire is because we believe that Green has access to many forms of ramp already, and does not need any more help from Moxen, and blue stands to gain far too much from a zero-cost, mana-generating, dedicated artifact.
<br><br>
Finally, we want to address the recent ban decision made by Wizards of the Coast in regards to <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/depictions-racism-magic-2020-06-10">Depictions of Racism in Magic</a>. While we very much understand and respect Wizards of the Coast's decision on this matter, we have ultimately decided not to follow the same path in regard to the bans. This is due to ensuring that the format follows our philosophy that only cards that we deem as harmful to the health of the meta game are banned.
